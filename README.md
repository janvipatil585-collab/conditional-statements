# conditional-statements
This repository demonstrates the use of conditional statements in programming to control the flow of execution based on specific conditions. It covers fundamental decision-making constructs such as if, if-else, else-if, and nested conditions, along with practical examples to show how different conditions affect program behavior.
The examples are written in a clear and beginner-friendly manner, focusing on:

.Evaluating logical and relational expressions

.Making decisions based on user input or variable values

.Improving code readability and logic using conditions

This project is useful for students and beginners who want to understand how programs make decisions and how conditional logic is applied in real-world problem solving.
